This is a complete example of a Flask server I would teach my students to develop for my AI/Machine Learning class at Coding Minds Academy. In it, I have the following:
- Example functions to demonstrate how URL routes work to call different functions
- Two sentiment analysis functions that use TextBlob's built-in Sentiment Polarity scoring
  - One scrapes an example website for quotes to perform sentiment analysis on
  - The other takes a user quote from the URL and runs a sentiment analysis run on it
- Two prediction functions using SciKit's Linear and Polynomial Regression Learning Models

TO-DO:
- Upload example of JavaScript website to demonstrate Front-End Development example
- Upload Thunkable app to demonstrate Mobile Front-End Development Example
